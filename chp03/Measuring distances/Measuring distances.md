# Measuring distances
## Use Case
* Measure distance
* Find out how considering the earth's curvature makes a big difference when measuring distances between distant points.
## Recipe
* `ST_Distance`: to calculate the distances
* `ST_DistanceSphere` and `ST_DistanceSpheroid`: to calculate the distance under different CRS

## Lesson Learnt
* Introduce to `Common Table Expression (CTE)`
